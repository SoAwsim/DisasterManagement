# Disaster Management

An Android app we have developped during the CSE 344 Software Engineering lecture at Yeditepe University.
We also worked with Industrial Engineering students who are taking ISE 402 System Design course to determine the requirements.
All of the documentation and the code of the project can be found in this repository.

# Disclaimer

This app uses randomly generated data in its database therefore it does not represent an actual disaster management scenario.
The goal of this project was to develop a sufficiently complex software project to practice the development methodologies we have learnt during the CSE 344 lecture.
