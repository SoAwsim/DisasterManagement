# Disaster Management

An Android app we have developped during the CSE 344 Software Engineering lecture at Yeditepe University.
We also worked with Industrial Engineering students who are taking ISE 402 System Design course to determine the requirements.
All of the documentation and the code of the project can be found in this repository.
